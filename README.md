## About The Project

![Portfolio Screenshot](./public/projects/connectly.png)

This project represents a shift from "building components" to **"architecting systems."** It serves as a living proof-of-concept for the **2026 Web Engineering Gold Standard**, utilizing the latest bleeding-edge technologies to deliver an application that is performant, scalable, and resilient.

Unlike traditional portfolios, this application adopts **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** to decouple business logic from UI, ensuring that the codebase remains maintainable as it scales. It leverages a hybrid animation model (GSAP + Framer Motion) for optical stability and fully embraces the **React 19** ecosystem.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🏗️ Feature-Sliced Architecture (FSD):** Organized into layers (`app`, `pages`, `widgets`, `features`, `shared`) to enforce unidirectional data flow and prevent spaghetti dependencies.
- **⚡ Bleeding Edge Performance:** Powered by **Vite 7** with the Rust-based Rolldown bundler (future-ready) and **React 19**.
- **🎨 Hybrid Motion Engine:**
  - **GSAP:** Handles complex, timeline-based scroll choreography.
  - **Framer Motion:** Manages declarative layout transitions and micro-interactions.
- **📱 PWA & Offline Resilience:** Fully installable with advanced caching strategies (Workbox) to function seamlessly in offline environments.
- **♿ Headless Accessibility:** Built on **Radix UI** primitives to ensure 100% keyboard navigation and screen reader support without compromising visual freedom.
- **🌗 Dark Mode Intelligence:** A persistent, system-aware theming engine that prevents "flash of incorrect theme" (FOUC).

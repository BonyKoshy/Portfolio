## About The Project

![Portfolio Screenshot](./public/projects/connectly.png)

This is not just a static portfolio; it's a comprehensive single-page application designed to showcase my skills in a modern, interactive way. The core of this project is a seamless user experience, from fluid animations with Framer Motion to a fully functional AI assistant powered by Google's Gemini model.

The application is built with a focus on performance, security, and maintainability, utilizing a serverless architecture for the AI integration and configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline capabilities.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **ü§ñ Gemini AI Assistant:** An interactive chatbot, powered by a Netlify serverless function, that's been custom-trained to answer questions about my skills, projects, and professional journey.
* **üåó Light & Dark Mode:** A sleek, user-toggleable theme switcher that persists across sessions using `localStorage`.
* **üì± Fully Responsive Design:** A mobile-first approach ensures a pixel-perfect experience on all devices, from phones to desktops.
* **üöÄ Progressive Web App (PWA):** The site is fully installable and features a service worker for asset caching and offline access.
* **Motion & Animation:** Smooth page transitions and micro-interactions are implemented with **Framer Motion** to create a dynamic and engaging UI.
* **üìù Serverless Form Handling:** The contact form uses Netlify's built-in form handling, submitted via a secure AJAX request.
